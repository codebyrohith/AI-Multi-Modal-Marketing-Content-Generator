# AI-Powered Multimodal Marketing Content Generator with Customizable Product Visualization

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered solution designed to automate e-commerce marketing content creation and enable real-time product customization. The system integrates a React-based frontend with a Flask backend and leverages advanced AI models:

- **Marketing Content Generation:** Uses a pre-trained Large Language Model via the Groq API to generate compelling marketing copy from user-uploaded images.
- **Image Customization:** Employs a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model enhanced with ControlNet to customize product images in real time based on user-defined prompts.

## Features

- **Image Upload & Marketing Content Generation:**

  - Upload images through the chat interface.
  - Convert images to Base64 and send to the `/upload_image` endpoint.
  - Generate marketing content using the Groq API.
  - Receive a unique `user_id` and view AI-generated marketing copy in a dynamic chat interface.

- **Chat Interaction:**

  - Enter prompts to interact with the system.
  - Continue conversations linked to your uploaded image.
  - View chat history and previous interactions via dedicated GET endpoints.

- **Image Customization:**

  - Switch to the image customization tab to modify product images.
  - Send images and customization prompts to the `/customize` endpoint.
  - Receive and display modified images generated by Stable Diffusion with ControlNet.

- **Real-Time Updates:**
  - Responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.
  - Seamless integration between frontend and backend APIs for a smooth user experience.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:**  
  Built with React, featuring a dynamic chat interface that handles two primary functions: marketing content generation and image customization. Utilizes Context API for state management and Axios for API calls.

- **Backend:**  
  Developed using Flask with multiple endpoints:
  - **POST `/upload_image`:** Handles image uploads, converts images to Base64, and communicates with the Groq API.
  - **POST `/chat`:** Processes chat prompts to generate marketing content linked with a unique `user_id`.
  - **POST `/customize`:** Processes image customization requests using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model integrated with ControlNet.
  - **GET `/get_all_chats` & `/get_chat/<user_id>`:** Retrieve chat histories and details.
- **External AI Services:**
  - **Groq API:** Powers marketing content generation.
  - **Stable Diffusion with ControlNet:** Handles image customization with enhanced structure preservation via edge detection.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Backend:**
  - Python 3.8+
  - Flask
  - Flask-CORS
  - Torch
  - diffusers
  - OpenCV
  - PIL (Pillow)
- **Frontend:**
  - Node.js (v14+)
  - npm or yarn

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-multimodal-marketing.git
   cd ai-multimodal-marketing/backend
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The server will run on port 5000 by default.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Marketing Content Generation:**

  1. Upload a product image via the chat interface.
  2. The image is processed by the backend and sent to the Groq API.
  3. Generated marketing content is displayed along with a unique `user_id`.
  4. Interact with the chat interface to refine and update marketing content.

- **Image Customization:**
  1. Switch to the image customization tab.
  2. Upload an image and enter a customization prompt.
  3. The image is preprocessed (using Canny edge detection) and modified via the Stable Diffusion model with ControlNet.
  4. The customized image is displayed in the interface.

## API Endpoints

- **POST `/upload_image`**
  - **Request:** Base64-encoded image.
  - **Response:** JSON containing `user_id`, generated marketing content, and status message.
- **POST `/chat`**
  - **Request:** JSON with `user_id` and prompt.
  - **Response:** AI-generated marketing response appended to the chat history.
- **POST `/customize`**
  - **Request:** JSON with Base64-encoded image and customization prompt.
  - **Response:** JSON containing a modified image in Base64 format.
- **GET `/get_all_chats`**
  - **Response:** List of all chat histories.
- **GET `/get_chat/<user_id>`**
  - **Response:** Detailed chat history for the specified `user_id`.
